My name is Patrick and I am in eleventh grade. I attend North Shore High School in New York. 


I am the lead of control systems and programming for [@FRC3950](https://github.com/FRC3950). 


I am a Java devotee. If there were Java churches, I could be a preacher. 


I also like cats and other soft animals.
